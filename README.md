# Quick summary:
- Disable picking flowers with spacebar
- Add any items to blacklist / whitelist from in-game so they are either not picked up or picked up first
- Prioritize meat first/last for safe and efficient spider and bunny farms
- Prioritize actions (ie. choping trees) over picking up itemsl (ie. logs), and vice versa
- Bind a key binding to change any of theese in-game

## Available options
- **Flowers pick up**
    - Default
    - No flowers
- **Pick up Order**
    - Default
    - Pick up first
    - Pick up last
- **Meat Priority**
    - Default
    - Meat first
    - No meat

## Key bindings
For any option you can set a key bind to cycle through them in game, without changing it in main menu. Additionally you can (actually you need to if you want to use it) set a key in the mod options and then while in game, point at an item on ground and press the chosen key to add the item to a blacklist / whitelist. The lists are saved on your computer, so you can set them once in game, and use them after re-logs or on a different server (can be toogled off in the options).

Available keys are F1 to F12, and A to Z. For any of theese ***you can still pick it up with your mouse.*** The mod only disables automatic picking with action key (spacebar by default)

## Usages

**Switch between items in the blacklist and whitelist while collecting your loot**  
*First nitre and flint are added to blacklist so they can't be picked, then they are removed so they can be picked again and flint is added to whitelist so it will be picked up first*
